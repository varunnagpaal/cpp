# C++ code and projects

###C++11 Folder
This folder contains small C++11/14 code snippets that I created while learning myriad of new language features and STL containers/algorithms in C++11/14.
You will notice two issues with most code snippets: illegible file names and self-contained single file cpp examples. 
The reason for this is simply that I have mostly relied on online c++ compiler tools such as [Ideone](http://www.ideone.com) to learn C++11/14 features.
For the time being, the folder name addresses the filename problem. As this is an ongoing work, expect to see fixes to such subtle issues(filename, multifile programs)
