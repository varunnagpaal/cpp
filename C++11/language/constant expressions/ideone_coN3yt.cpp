// const: promises that after initilization of symbolic constant(at compile-time or run-time), 
// its value cannot be modified. It restricts the ways in which an object can be used, rather
// than specifying how the constant is to be allocated.
//
// Core Constant expressions: compile-time constants or "expressions which are evaluated
// to a constant value and bound to a symbol by the compiler only at compile-time
// and not run-time". Compile time constants defined this way have clearly defined
// type information at compile time unlike macros where no type information
// is associated with the expression at compile time
//
// Ultimately, a core constant expression must start out with an integral value, 
// a floating-point value, or an enumerator, and we can combine those using
// operators and constexpr functions that in turn produce values.
// 
// Difference between const and constexpr
// A variable marked const may be evaluated and initialized at compile-time or at runtime but it cannot be modified at run-time
// A variable marked constexpr is evaluated and initialized at compile-time and it cannot be initialized at run-time

// compile-time constants are required in following places at compile-time
// - template parameters
// - labels of case statement of switch construct
// - array bounds: must be a constant expression
//
// constexpr for example might come handy to evaluate expressions to calculate
// - array-bounds 
// - values of non-type template parameters
// - labels of case statement
// - complex compile time value based on complex formulaes
//
// initilization done by constexpr at compile-time ensures no thread-races
// which could happen with const initialized by multiple threads at run-time
